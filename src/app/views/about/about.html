      GeOMe is an implementation of the
      <a href="http://gensc.org/projects/migo/" target="_blank"
        >“Minimum Information about a Genomic Observatory” (MIGO)</a>
      checklist, requiring the following fields at the very minimum for all implementing
      configurations and projects:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>materialSampleID</li>
      <li>yearCollected</li>

    <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Each of the provided configurations may choose to enforce additional rules that extend the GeOMe network rules.
      </li>
      <li>
        Controlled vocabularies are enforced for the following fields: country, container,
        horizontalDatum, lengthUnits, lifeStage, markers, phylum, preservative, relaxant, sex,
        taxonRank, basisOfIdentification, and weightUnits. FASTQ metadata controlled vocabularies include:

    <p>
      GeOMe has its roots in the Moorea Biocode project database, developed from 2006 to 2011 to
      support data collection for the Moore Foundation funded Moorea Biocode Project: an all taxa
      biotic inventory of a single tropical island involving 6 teams, 50 researchers, and thousands
      of collecting events. The Moorea Biocode field information management system, also known as
      "FIMS1", was developed to ingest spreadsheet data from researchers working on the project and
      employed data validation on data ingest. The tools were written in Perl and Java. FIMS1 has
      been running from 2006 through 2018 and developed tools such as the Plate Matcher (to easily
      map tissues to 96 well plates), the bioValidator (for loading and validating spreadsheets),
      and a web interface for managing data.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 2012 to 2015, the National Science Foundation funded the BiSciCol (Biological Sciences
      Collections) project. While BiSciCol focused on identifiers, ontologies, and semantic
      technologies for linking biodiversity data, the primary use case was to work on a solution for
      linking events, samples, and tissues across many different systems using linked data
      technology with the Moorea Biocode Project data integration with member institution databases.
      BiScicol brought us the following products: a clearer understanding of the role of persistent
      identifiers, the
      <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-15-257"
        >BiSciCol triplifier</a
      >, the development of the
      <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0089606">
        Biological Collections Ontology (BCO)</a
      >, and the development of FIMS2, also known as the
      <a href="http://biscicol.org/">BiSciCol FIMS</a>. The BiSciCol FIMS adopted ARK identifiers
      (through California Digital Library's EZID system) for all samples, events and tissues. In
      addition, all data inserted into BiSciCol FIMS was backed by a Fuseki triplestore with
      metadata configurations specified using an XML configuration file, stored and managed
      separately by each project.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 2014-2017, BiSciCol FIMS began hosting the Diversity of the IndoPacific Network (DIPNet)
      to develop a coherent metadata repository for assembling metadata from across the IndoPacific
      region. DIPNet added the ability to upload FASTA and FASTQ metadata to the FIMS2 site and also
      developed the name "GeOMe" (eventually becaming the brand name for FIMS3). During this
      time-frame, another FIMS system was developed for the Smithosnian National Museum of Natural
      History ("NMNH FIMS") with the goal of creating a centralized field data ingestion system for
      all NMNH field data. The NMNH FIMS has since been discontinued with SI users using the
      BiSciCol FIMS (Barcode of Wildlife Project, ARMS portal, and Global Genome Initiative) and
      FIMS1 installations (Invertebrate Zoology and LAB applications).
    </p>
    <p>
      Beginning in 2016, John Deck and RJ Ewing started work on a redesigned FIMS system, utilizing
      a Postgres backend to control project management features and JSON metadata objects to store
      data and configurations. This FIMS system (FIMS3) assumed the name GeOMe. It incorporates
      features from FIMS1 (including photo uploading, specimen, tissue, and event pages,
      plate-matching tools) along with features of the BiSciCol FIMS (persistent id generation,
      flexible project configuration with attributes stored in a non-relational system guided by a
      configuration file). In addition, FIMS3 brings in the concept of a network which governs
      multiple configuration templates and the ability to easily create projects through a user
      interface. The goal of GeOMe is to integrate all previous FIMS1 and FIMS2, with FIMS1 and
      FIMS2 projects removed from their current hosting environment by Spring of 2019.
